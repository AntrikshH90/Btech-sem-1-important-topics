## 📘 UNIT 1: Environment & Ecosystem

### 1. What is an Ecosystem?
**Ans:** An ecosystem is a functional unit of nature where living organisms (biotic) interact with each other and with their physical environment (abiotic).
*   **Example:** Pond, Forest, Grassland.

### 2. Structure of Ecosystem
*   **Abiotic (Non-living):** Air, water, soil, sunlight, temperature.
*   **Biotic (Living):**
    1.  **Producers (Autotrophs):** Make their own food (Green plants).
    2.  **Consumers (Heterotrophs):** Depend on others (Herbivores, Carnivores).
    3.  **Decomposers (Saprotrophs):** Break down dead matter (Bacteria, Fungi).

### 3. Food Chain vs Food Web
*   **Food Chain:** Linear sequence of energy transfer. (Grass → Deer → Lion)
*   **Food Web:** Complex network of interconnected food chains. (More stable).

### 4. Ecological Pyramids
Graphical representation of ecological parameters.
1.  **Pyramid of Number:** Can be upright (Grassland) or inverted (Tree ecosystem).
2.  **Pyramid of Biomass:** Upright (Forest) or inverted (Pond).
3.  **Pyramid of Energy:** **ALWAYS UPRIGHT**. Energy decreases at each level (10% Law).

### 5. Nitrogen Cycle (Short Steps)
1.  **Fixation:** $N_2$ to Ammonia (by Rhizobium bacteria).
2.  **Nitrification:** Ammonia to Nitrates.
3.  **Assimilation:** Plants use Nitrates.
4.  **Ammonification:** Dead matter back to Ammonia.
5.  **Denitrification:** Nitrates back to $N_2$ gas.

## 📘 UNIT 2: Natural Resources

### 1. Renewable vs Non-Renewable Resources
*   **Renewable:** Can be replenished (Solar, Wind, Water, Forest).
*   **Non-Renewable:** Exhaustible, cannot be replenished (Coal, Petroleum, Minerals).

### 2. Deforestation
*   **Causes:** Agriculture expansion, urbanization, mining, dams.
*   **Effects:** Soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, global warming, floods.

### 3. Water Resources Issues
*   **Floods:** Excess water due to heavy rain/deforestation.
*   **Droughts:** Scarcity of water due to low rain/over-use.
*   **Conflicts:** Disputes over river water (e.g., Cauvery water dispute).

### 4. Energy Resources
*   **Solar Energy:** Photovoltaic cells convert sunlight to electricity. Clean & infinite.
*   **Biomass:** Energy from organic matter (wood, crop residue).
*   **Hydro Power:** Energy from flowing water.

## 📘 UNIT 3: Biodiversity

### 1. Levels of Biodiversity
1.  **Genetic Diversity:** Variation of genes within a species (e.g., varieties of rice).
2.  **Species Diversity:** Variety of species in a region.
3.  **Ecosystem Diversity:** Variety of habitats (Forest, Desert, Marine).

### 2. Threats to Biodiversity (HIPPO)
*   **H**abitat Loss (Main cause).
*   **I**nvasive Species.
*   **P**opulation Growth.
*   **P**ollution.
*   **O**ver-exploitation (Hunting/Poaching).

### 3. Conservation of Biodiversity (Important!)
*   **In-situ (On-site):** Protecting species in their natural habitat.
    *   *Examples:* National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, Biosphere Reserves.
*   **Ex-situ (Off-site):** Protecting species outside their natural habitat.
    *   *Examples:* Zoos, Botanical Gardens, Seed Banks, Gene Banks.

### 4. Hotspots of Biodiversity
Regions with high species richness and high endemism (species found nowhere else) but are under threat.
*   **India's Hotspots:** Western Ghats, Himalayas, Indo-Burma, Sundaland.

## 📘 UNIT 4: Environmental Pollution

### 1. Air Pollution
*   **Primary Pollutants:** Directly emitted ($CO$, $SO_2$, $NO_x$).
*   **Secondary Pollutants:** Formed by reaction ($Ozone$, $Smog$, $Acid Rain$).
*   **Control:** Electrostatic Precipitators, Scrubbers, Catalytic Converters.

### 2. Water Pollution
*   **Point Source:** Specific pipe/drain (Factory outlet).
*   **Non-point Source:** Scattered (Agricultural runoff).
*   **BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand):** Amount of oxygen needed by bacteria to decompose organic matter. High BOD = High Pollution.

### 3. Solid Waste Management
*   **3R Principle:** Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.
*   **Landfills:** Dumping waste in pits.
*   **Incineration:** Burning waste (generates energy but causes air pollution).
*   **Composting:** Natural decomposition of organic waste.

### 4. Noise Pollution
*   **Unit:** Decibel (dB).
*   **Effects:** Hypertension, hearing loss, stress, sleep disturbance.

## 📘 UNIT 5: Social Issues & Environment

### 1. Sustainable Development
**Definition:** Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
*   **Pillars:** Economic, Social, Environmental.

### 2. Climate Change & Global Warming
*   **Greenhouse Effect:** Trapping of heat by gases ($CO_2$, Methane).
*   **Effects:** Melting ice caps, rising sea levels, extreme weather.

### 3. Acid Rain
*   **Causes:** $SO_2$ and $NO_x$ react with rain water to form Sulfuric/Nitric acid.
*   **Effects:** Damages monuments (Taj Mahal), kills fish, harms soil.

### 4. Ozone Layer Depletion
*   **Cause:** CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) from ACs/Fridges.
*   **Effect:** UV rays reach earth $\rightarrow$ Skin cancer, Cataract.
*   **Protection:** Montreal Protocol (Treaty to phase out CFCs).

### 5. Environmental Acts (Short Notes)
*   **Environment Protection Act (1986):** Umbrella act for protection.
*   **Air Act (1981):** Prevention of air pollution.
*   **Water Act (1974):** Prevention of water pollution.
*   **Wildlife Protection Act (1972):** Protection of animals/plants.
