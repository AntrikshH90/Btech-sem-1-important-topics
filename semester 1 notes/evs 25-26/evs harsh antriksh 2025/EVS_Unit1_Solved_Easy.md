# EVS Unit 1: Solved Past Year Questions (Easy Manner)

Here are the questions that came from **Unit 1 (Environment & Ecosystem)** in the last 2 years (2022-24), solved in a very easy-to-learn format.

## 📅 Question 1: Ecosystem (10 Marks) [2023-24]
**Q. Define Ecosystem. Explain the structure and function of an ecosystem.**

### **Answer (Easy Version):**

**1. Definition:**
*   **Ecosystem:** It is a community where **Living** (Biotic) and **Non-Living** (Abiotic) things interact with each other.
*   *Example:* A pond (Fish + Water + Sun).

**2. Structure (What is it made of?):**
> **Think:** Two main teams - Life vs Non-Life.

*   **A. Abiotic Components (Non-Living):**
    *   **Physical:** Sunlight, Temperature, Soil.
    *   **Chemical:** Water, Oxygen, Minerals.
*   **B. Biotic Components (Living):**
    *   **Producers:** Green Plants (Make their own food using Sun).
    *   **Consumers:** Animals (Eat plants or other animals).
        *   *Herbivores:* Eat plants (Cow).
        *   *Carnivores:* Eat animals (Lion).
    *   **Decomposers:** Bacteria/Fungi (Cleaners who eat dead bodies).

**3. Functions (What does it do?):**
*   **Energy Flow:** Sun gives energy to Plants $\rightarrow$ Animals eat Plants.
*   **Nutrient Cycling:** Nutrients go from Soil $\rightarrow$ Plants $\rightarrow$ Animals $\rightarrow$ Back to Soil (after death).
*   **Food Chains:** Who eats whom?

## 📅 Question 2: Food Chain vs Food Web (5 Marks) [2023-24]
**Q. Differentiate between Food Chain and Food Web.**

### **Answer (Easy Version):**

| Feature | Food Chain (Simple Line) | Food Web (Complex Net) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Concept** | A single path of eating. | Many food chains connected together. |
| **Logic** | **Grass $\rightarrow$ Deer $\rightarrow$ Lion** | A Lion eats Deer, but also Zebra and Fox. |
| **Stability** | **Unstable:** If Deer dies, Lion starves. | **Stable:** If Deer dies, Lion eats Zebra. |
| **Reality** | Doesn't exist alone in nature. | Real condition of nature. |

## 📅 Question 3: Ecological Pyramids (5 Marks) [2022-23]
**Q. Explain the concept of Ecological Pyramids.**

### **Answer (Easy Version):**

**1. Definition:**
*   A diagram (triangle shape) that shows the relationship between organisms at different levels.

**2. Three Types:**
*   **A. Pyramid of Number (Count):**
    *   How many? (e.g., Many grass blades, few lions).
    *   *Usually Upright.*
*   **B. Pyramid of Biomass (Weight):**
    *   Total weight of organisms.
    *   *Examples:* Forest (Upright), Pond (Inverted - because small algae weigh less than big fish).
*   **C. Pyramid of Energy (Power):**
    *   **ALWAYS UPRIGHT.**
    *   **Why?** Because when one animal eats another, energy is lost as heat. Only 10% goes up (**10% Law**).

## 📅 Question 4: Multidisciplinary Nature (2 Marks) [2022-23]
**Q. What is the Multidisciplinary nature of Environmental Studies?**

### **Answer (Easy Version):**

*   **Multidisciplinary** means "Many Subjects MIXED".
*   EVS is not just one subject, it uses knowledge from:
    1.  **Biology:** To study plants/animals.
    2.  **Chemistry:** To study pollution.
    3.  **Physics:** To study energy flow.
    4.  **Maths:** To count population/data.
    5.  **Law:** For rules to protect nature.

## 📅 Question 5: Types of Environment (2-5 Marks)
**Q. Discuss different types of Environment.**

### **Answer (Easy Version):**

> **Mnemonic:** **N M S**

**1. Natural Environment:**
*   Created by nature without humans.
*   **Abiotic:** Air, Water, Soil.
*   **Biotic:** Plants, Animals.

**2. Man-Made Environment:**
*   Built by humans for comfort/needs.
*   *Examples:* Houses, Roads, Factories, Bridges.

**3. Social Environment:**
*   Refers to the rules and society we live in.
*   *Examples:* Culture, Laws, Education, Economics.
