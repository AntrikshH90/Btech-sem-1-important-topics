## 🌎 UNIT 1: Ecosystem & Environment

**Q1. Define Ecosystem.**
**Ans:** An ecosystem is a functional unit of nature where living organisms (biotic) interact among themselves and with their physical environment (abiotic).

**Q2. What is the multidisciplinary nature of Environmental Studies?**
**Ans:** It is multidisciplinary because it integrates knowledge from various fields like Biology (Life), Chemistry & Physics (Physical), Sociology & Economics (Social), and Law (Policy).

**Q3. Name the layers of the atmosphere in order.**
**Ans:** 
1. Troposphere (lowest)
2. Stratosphere (contains Ozone)
3. Mesosphere
4. Thermosphere
5. Exosphere (outermost)

**Q4. What is the composition of air?**
**Ans:** Nitrogen (78%), Oxygen (21%), Argon (0.9%), and others like $CO_2$ and water vapor (0.1%).

**Q5. Define Food Chain.**
**Ans:** A linear sequence of organisms where nutrients and energy are transferred from one level to another (e.g., Grass $\rightarrow$ Deer $\rightarrow$ Lion).

**Q6. What is a Food Web?**
**Ans:** A complex network of interconnected food chains. It is more stable and realistic than a food chain.

**Q7. State the 10% Law of energy flow.**
**Ans:** Proposed by Lindeman, it states that only 10% of the energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next; the rest is lost as heat.

## 💧 UNIT 2: Natural Resources

**Q8. Define Sustainable Development.**
**Ans:** Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

**Q9. Differentiate between Renewable and Non-renewable resources.**
**Ans:**
*   **Renewable:** Resources that can be replenished naturally (Solar, Wind).
*   **Non-renewable:** Resources that exist in fixed amounts and take millions of years to form (Coal, Petrol).

**Q10. What is Deforestation?**
**Ans:** The permanent removal or thinning of forests by humans for agriculture, urbanization, or timber.

**Q11. What is Biogas?**
**Ans:** A mixture of gases (mainly Methane ~60% and $CO_2$) produced by the anaerobic decomposition of organic waste like cow dung.

**Q12. What is Nitrogen Fixation?**
**Ans:** The process of converting atmospheric nitrogen ($N_2$) into ammonia ($NH_3$) by lightning or bacteria like *Rhizobium*.

## 🏭 UNIT 3: Environmental Pollution

**Q13. Define Air Pollution.**
**Ans:** The presence of harmful substances (smoke, dust, chemicals) in the air that causes undesirable changes and hurts living beings and nature.

**Q14. What are the 3Rs of Waste Management?**
**Ans:** **Reduce** (create less waste), **Reuse** (use items again), and **Recycle** (make new products from waste).

**Q15. Define BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand).**
**Ans:** The amount of oxygen required by bacteria to break down organic waste in water. *High BOD = Dirty Water.*

**Q16. Define COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand).**
**Ans:** The amount of oxygen required to chemically break down both organic and inorganic waste in water.

**Q17. What is Noise Pollution and its unit?**
**Ans:** Unwanted or disturbing sound that affects health. It is measured in **Decibels (dB)**. (Safe limit: < 65 dB).

**Q18. What is Minamata Disease?**
**Ans:** A neurological disease caused by severe **Mercury (Hg)** poisoning, first discovered in Minamata Bay, Japan.

**Q19. What is Itai-Itai Disease?**
**Ans:** A painful bone disease caused by **Cadmium (Cd)** poisoning.

**Q20. What happened in the Bhopal Gas Tragedy?**
**Ans:** On Dec 2-3, 1984, a toxic gas named **MIC (Methyl Isocyanate)** leaked from a Union Carbide pesticide plant, killing thousands.

## 🔥 UNIT 4: Current Environmental Issues

**Q21. What is the Greenhouse Effect?**
**Ans:** A natural process where gases like $CO_2$ trap heat in the atmosphere, keeping Earth warm.

**Q22. Define Global Warming.**
**Ans:** An increase in Earth's average temperature due to the **enhanced** Greenhouse Effect caused by excessive pollution.

**Q23. What is Acid Rain?**
**Ans:** Rain with a **pH less than 5.6**. It is caused by $SO_2$ and $NO_x$ reacting with water vapor.

**Q24. What is Ozone Layer Depletion?**
**Ans:** The thinning of the Ozone layer ($O_3$) in the Stratosphere, mainly caused by **CFCs** (Chlorofluorocarbons).

**Q25. What is the Montreal Protocol?**
**Ans:** An international treaty (1987) designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of CFCs.

**Q26. What is Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)?**
**Ans:** A process to evaluate the potential environmental impact of a proposed project *before* it starts.

## 👥 UNIT 5: Human Population & Environment

**Q27. Define Population Explosion.**
**Ans:** A sudden and massive increase in population size that exceeds the carrying capacity of the environment.

**Q28. What is the goal of the Family Welfare Programme?**
**Ans:** To stabilize population growth and improve the health of mothers and children (Launched in India, 1952).

**Q29. What are the main objectives of the Environment Protection Act, 1986?**
**Ans:** To protect and improve the environment, set standards for pollutants, and penalize polluters. (Umbrella Legislation).

**Q30. Name any two international Environmental NGOs.**
**Ans:** 
1. **WWF** (World Wide Fund for Nature)
2. **Greenpeace**

**Q31. Define Urbanization.**
**Ans:** The shift of population from rural (villages) to urban (cities) areas, leading to the growth of cities.

**Q32. What is the relationship between Women Education and Population?**
**Ans:** Higher female literacy leads to a lower fertility rate (fewer children) because educated women marry later and are more aware of family planning.

**Q33. Why is Carbon Monoxide (CO) more harmful than $CO_2$?**
**Ans:** CO has a 200-300 times higher affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen. it forms **Carboxyhemoglobin** which stops blood from carrying oxygen, leading to instant suffocation or death. $CO_2$ is only harmful in very high concentrations.
