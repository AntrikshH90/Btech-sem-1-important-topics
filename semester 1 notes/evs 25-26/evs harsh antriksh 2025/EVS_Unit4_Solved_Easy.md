## 📅 Question 1: Global Warming & Greenhouse Effect (10 Marks) [2023-24]
**Q. Explain Global Warming / Greenhouse Effect, its causes, consequences, and remedies.**

### **Answer (Easy Version):**

**1. Definition:**
*   **Greenhouse Effect:** The natural process where atmospheric gases (like CO2, Methane) trap heat from the Sun, preventing it from escaping back into space.
*   **Global Warming:** The **extra heating** of Earth because of **too much pollution** ($CO_2$, smoke) trapping more heat than necessary.

**2. Causes (Who is the villain?):**
*   **Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$):** Burning coal, petrol, and cutting trees. (The main villain).
*   **Methane ($CH_4$):** Garbage dumps and cattle (cow) digestion.
*   **CFCs:** From ACs and fridges.
*   **Nitrous Oxide ($N_2O$):** Fertilizers in farming.

**3. Consequences / Effects (What happens?):**
> **Mnemonic:** **MAIL - H**
*   **M - Melting Ice Caps:** The ice at poles is melting.
*   **A - Agriculture Suffer:** Crops die due to unpredictable rain and heat.
*   **I - Islands Submerge:** Small islands will drown under water soon.
*   **L - Level Rise:** Sea level rises, causing floods in coastal cities (like Mumbai).
*   **H - Health Issues:** New diseases spread (Malaria, Dengue) because mosquitoes love warm weather.
    *   **The Science:** Warmth allows mosquitoes to **breed faster** and helps the virus inside them **mature quickly**.

**4. Remedies (How to stop it?):**
> **Mnemonic:** **RIDE**
*   **R - Renewable Energy:** Use Solar and Wind power instead of burning Coal/Petrol.
*   **I - Increase Greenery:** Plant more trees (Afforestation) to absorb $CO_2$.
*   **D - Decrease Pollution:** Use Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Public Transport.
*   **E - Efficiency:** Use energy-efficient appliances (like LED bulbs and 5-star ACs).

## 📅 Question 2: Acid Rain (5-10 Marks) [2022-23]
**Q. What is Acid Rain? Discuss its causes, effects, and control measures (remedies).**

### **Answer (Easy Version):**

**1. Definition:**
*   Normal rain has pH ~5.6.
*   **Acid Rain** is rain with **pH less than 5.6** (It is acidic like lemon juice).

**2. The Gases & Formation (The Chemistry):**
*   **Gases involved:** **Sulphur Dioxide ($SO_2$)** and **Nitrogen Oxides ($NO_x$)**.
*   **Core Causes:** Smoke from **Coal Factories** and **Vehicles**.
*   **Equations (Must write for full marks):**
    1.  $SO_2 + H_2O \rightarrow H_2SO_4$ (**Sulphuric Acid**)
    2.  $NO_x + H_2O \rightarrow HNO_3$ (**Nitric Acid**)

**3. Effects (What is damaged?):**
> **Mnemonic:** **S A T**
*   **S - Stone Leprosy:** It "eats" marble and limestone. (Example: **Taj Mahal** is turning yellow).
*   **A - Aquatic Life:** It makes lake water acidic, killing fish and plants.
*   **T - Trees & Soil:** It removes nutrients from soil, making trees weak and dry.

**4. Remedies (Control Measures):**
> **Mnemonic:** **C L E R**
*   **C - Cleaner Fuels:** Use LPG/CNG or Low-Sulphur coal in industries.
*   **L - Liming:** Adding **Lime** (Calcium Carbonate) to acidic lakes to neutralize the acid.
*   **E - Exhaust Control:** Using "Scrubbers" in factory chimneys to filter out $SO_2$ before it reaches the sky.
*   **R - Renewable Energy:** Shift to Solar and Wind to reduce burning of Fossil Fuels.

## 📅 Question 3: Ozone Layer Depletion (7-10 Marks) [2022-23]
**Q. Discuss Ozone Layer Depletion: Causes, Effects, and Solutions.**

### **Answer (7-Mark Version):**

**1. What is Ozone ($O_3$)?**
*   It is a tri-atomic form of oxygen found in the **Stratosphere** (20-30 km above Earth).
*   **The Shield:** It acts as a "Sunscreen" for Earth, blocking 99% of harmful **UV-B and UV-C rays**.

**2. The Mechanism of Depletion (How it breaks):**
*   **The Villain:** **CFCs** (Chlorofluorocarbons) from ACs and Refrigerators.
*   **The Reaction:** UV rays break CFCs to release **Chlorine ($Cl$)**.
*   **Equation (Write this for full marks):**
    1.  $Cl + O_3 \rightarrow ClO + O_2$
    2.  $ClO + O \rightarrow Cl + O_2$
    *(Note: One Cl atom can destroy **1,00,000** ozone molecules!)*

**3. Effects (The Damage):**
> **Mnemonic:** **H E P** (Human, Environment, Plants)
*   **H - Human Health:** Causes **Skin Cancer**, **Cataracts** (blindness), and **Weak Immunity**.
*   **E - Environmental:** Kills **Phytoplankton** (small plants in the sea), which disturbs the entire ocean food chain.
*   **P - Plant Growth:** Damages crops and reduces their nutritional value.

**4. Solutions / Remedies:**
*   **Montreal Protocol (1987):** An international treaty to ban the use of CFCs.
*   **Replace CFCs:** Use **HFCs** (Hydrofluorocarbons) or **HCFCs** which are less harmful to ozone.
*   **Public Awareness:** Proper disposal of old fridges/ACs so gas doesn't leak.

> **💡 Pro-Tip for 7 Marks:** Draw a simple diagram!
> *   Draw a big **Sun** releasing "UV Rays".
> *   Draw a thick **Ozone Layer** around Earth.
> *   Show a **Hole** in one part with UV rays passing through to hit **Earth**.

**Summary for Exam:**
*   **Global Warming** = Earth getting hot ($CO_2$).
*   **Acid Rain** = Rain turning sour ($SO_2 + NO_x$).
*   **Ozone Depletion** = Shield breaking (CFCs).
