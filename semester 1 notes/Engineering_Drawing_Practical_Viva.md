# Engineering Drawing Practical Viva - Important Questions & Tips (AKTU)

## 🎯 General Tips for Practical Exam
1.  **Carry All Instruments**: ensure you have your mini-drafter, pencils (H, 2H, HB), eraser, sharpener, compass, protractor, and scale. Borrowing is often frowned upon.
2.  **Sheet Quality**: Keep your drawing sheet clean. Examiners often check for cleanliness and line quality (uniform thickness where needed).
3.  **Confidence**: When answering viva questions, be confident even if you are unsure. Definitions should be precise.
4.  **File/Portfolio**: Ensure your practical file is complete, indexed, and signed. This is the first impression.
5.  **Pencils Usage**: Know which pencil to use where (e.g., HB for lettering/boundary, 2H/3H for construction lines, H for object lines).

## 📝 Important Viva Questions (Topic Wise)

### 1. Introduction & Instruments
*   **Q: What is the standard size of a drawing board/sheet?**
    *   *Ans:* 
        *   A0: 841 x 1189 mm (Area ~ 1 sqm)
        *   A1: 594 x 841 mm
        *   A2: 420 x 594 mm
        *   A3: 297 x 420 mm
        *   A4: 210 x 297 mm
*   **Q: What is the use of a Mini-Drafter?**
    *   *Ans:* It combines the functions of a T-square, Set-Square, Scale, and Protractor. Used for drawing parallel/perpendicular lines and angles.
*   **Q: What do the pencil grades H, HB, B mean?**
    *   *Ans:* 'H' stands for Hardness (clay content), 'B' stands for Blackness (graphite content). 9H is hardest, 7B is softest/blackest. HB is medium.

### 2. Scales
*   **Q: What is Representative Fraction (R.F.)?**
    *   *Ans:* Ratio of the length of the drawing to the actual length of the object. RF = (Drawing Length) / (Actual Length). Units must be same.
*   **Q: What is the difference between Plain and Diagonal Scale?**
    *   *Ans:* Plain scale measures up to two consecutive units (e.g., cm and mm). Diagonal scale measures up to three consecutive units (e.g., m, dm, cm).
*   **Q: On what principle is a Diagonal Scale based?**
    *   *Ans:* Principle of Similar Triangles.
*   **Q: What is a Vernier Scale?**
    *   *Ans:* A scale used to measure very small sub-divisions using a sliding auxiliary scale (Vernier) along with a main scale.
*   **Q: What is Least Count?**
    *   *Ans:* The minimum measurement that can be read accurately on a scale.

### 3. Conic Sections
*   **Q: What is Eccentricity (e)?**
    *   *Ans:* Ratio of the distance of a point from the Focus to its distance from the Directrix.
        *   If e = 1, Parabola
        *   If e < 1, Ellipse
        *   If e > 1, Hyperbola
*   **Q: Name the methods to draw an Ellipse.**
    *   *Ans:* Concentric Circle Method, Rectangle (Oblong) Method, Arcs of Circles Method.
*   **Q: What are the applications of Parabolic curves?**
    *   *Ans:* Reflectors, Sound arches, Bridge arches.

### 4. Orthographic Projections
*   **Q: What is Orthographic Projection?**
    *   *Ans:* Projectors are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the plane of projection.
*   **Q: Why are 2nd and 4th Angles not used?**
    *   *Ans:* In 2nd and 4th quadrants, the Horizontal Plane (HP) and Vertical Plane (VP) overlap when the HP is rotated 90° clockwise, causing drawing confusion.
*   **Q: Difference between 1st and 3rd Angle Projection? (EASY VERSION)**
    *   *Ans:* Focus on where the **Top View** is drawn:
        *   **1st Angle:** Top View is drawn **BELOW** the Front View.
            *   *Logic:* Object is kept between Observer and Plane (O -> Obj -> P).
        *   **3rd Angle:** Top View is drawn **ABOVE** the Front View.
            *   *Logic:* Plane is transparent (glass) and kept between Observer and Object (O -> P -> Obj).
    *   *Short Trick:* 
        *   **1st** = Top acts like a weight, goes **Down**.
        *   **3rd** = Top floats up, goes **Up**.
*   **Q: What are Traces?**
    *   *Ans:* Points where a line or plane meets the reference planes (HT = Horizontal Trace, VT = Vertical Trace).

### 5. Projections of Planes & Solids
*   **Q: What is a regular polygon?**
    *   *Ans:* A polygon with equal sides and equal interior angles (e.g., Square, Regular Pentagon).
*   **Q: Difference between Prism and Pyramid?**
    *   *Ans:* 
        *   **Prism**: Has two identical bases (top and bottom) and rectangular side faces.
        *   **Pyramid**: Has one base and triangular faces meeting at a common apex.
*   **Q: What is a Frustum?**
    *   *Ans:* If a cone or pyramid is cut by a plane parallel to the base, the remaining bottom part is the Frustum. The top part is a smaller cone/pyramid.

### 6. Isometric Projection
*   **Q: Difference between Isometric View and Isometric Projection?**
    *   *Ans:*
        *   **Isometric View/Drawing**: Drawn using True Scale (Actual dimensions).
        *   **Isometric Projection**: Drawn using Isometric Scale (approx 0.816 x Actual dimensions).
*   **Q: What is the Isometric Angle?**
    *   *Ans:* The three axes are inclined at 120° to each other.
*   **Q: What is the Isometric Scale formula?**
    *   *Ans:* Isometric Length = 0.816 × True Length (or $\sqrt{2/3} \times \text{True Length}$).

### 7. AutoCAD (If applicable in Lab)
*   **Q: What function does F8 key perform?**
    *   *Ans:* Toggles Ortho mode (constrains lines to horizontal/vertical).
*   **Q: What is the difference between Trim and Erase?**
    *   *Ans:* Erase removes the whole object. Trim removes a part of an object cutting it at defined boundaries.
*   **Q: command for drawing a circle?**
    *   *Ans:* `C` or `CIRCLE`.
*   **Q: What is Offset?**
    *   *Ans:* Creates concentric circles, parallel lines, or parallel curves.

### 8. 📸 Quick-Fire "Easy" Answers (From Your Images)

    *   *Ans:* Drawing Board, T-Square, Mini-Drafter, Set-Squares (45°, 60°), Protractor, Compass, Divider, French Curves, Drawing Scale, Pencils, Eraser, Sharpener.
*   **Q: What is the size of the Title Block?**
    *   *Ans:* Standard student size usually **185 mm x 65 mm**.
*   **Q: Difference between Generating & Directing Circle?**
    *   *Ans:*
        *   **Generating Circle**: The circle that *rolls*.
        *   **Directing Circle**: The circle/line *on which* it rolls.
*   **Q: What are Cycloid, Epicycloid, Hypocycloid?**
    *   *Ans:*
        *   **Cycloid**: Circle rolls on a *straight line*.
        *   **Epicycloid**: Circle rolls on the *outside* of another circle.
        *   **Hypocycloid**: Circle rolls on the *inside* of another circle.
*   **Q: Least Count Formula?**
    *   *Ans:* `L.C. = (Value of 1 Main Scale Division) / (Total Divisions on Vernier Scale)`
*   **Q: Types of Solids (Classification)?**
    *   *Ans:*
        *   **Right Solid**: Axis is perpendicular to the base (std 90° upright).
        *   **Oblique Solid**: Axis is simplified/inclined (leaning tower).
        *   **Regular Solid**: Base is a regular polygon (equal sides).
*   **Q: Reducing vs Enlarging Scale?**
    *   *Ans:*
        *   **Reducing**: Drawing < Object (R.F. < 1) e.g., Maps.
        *   **Enlarging**: Drawing > Object (R.F. > 1) e.g., Screw threads, gears.
        *   **Full Scale**: Drawing = Object (R.F. = 1).
