### Q1. Explain the construction and working of He-Ne Laser. (10 Marks)
**Answer:**
**He-Ne Laser:** A four-level gas laser.
1.  **Active Medium:** Mixture of Helium and Neon (10:1 ratio).
2.  **Pumping:** Electric Discharge.
3.  **Working:**
    *   He atoms excited by electron collision.
    *   Energy transfer from He to Ne atoms (Resonant transfer).
    *   Population inversion achieved in Ne atoms.
    *   Laser transition gives red light (6328 Å).

### Q2. Define Numerical Aperture (NA) and Acceptance Angle. (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
*   **Acceptance Angle:** The maximum angle at which light can enter the fiber and undergo total internal reflection.
*   **Numerical Aperture (NA):** Light gathering capacity of the fiber.
    *   `NA = sin(Acceptance Angle) = √(n₁² - n₂²)`
    *   n₁ = Core index, n₂ = Cladding index.

### Q1. Explain the principle of Optical Fiber. Discuss types of fibers. (10 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Principle:** Total Internal Reflection (TIR). Light must travel from denser (Core) to rarer (Cladding) medium at angle > Critical Angle.

**Types:**
1.  **Step Index Fiber:**
    *   **Single Mode:** Small core, one path.
    *   **Multi Mode:** Large core, multiple paths (Intermodal dispersion).
2.  **Graded Index (GRIN) Fiber:** Refractive index decreases gradually from axis to cladding. Reduces dispersion.

### Q2. Explain Einstein's Coefficients (A and B). (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
1.  **Spontaneous Emission (A₂₁):** Atom falls to lower state randomly.
2.  **Stimulated Absorption (B₁₂):** Atom absorbs photon to go up.
3.  **Stimulated Emission (B₂₁):** Incident photon triggers emission of identical photon (Laser principle).
*   **Relation:** `A₂₁/B₂₁` is proportional to `ν³`.
