### Q1. Discuss the formation of Newton's Rings. Derive the expression for diameter of bright and dark rings. (10 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Newton's Rings:** Formed due to interference between light reflected from the top surface of the air film and the bottom surface of the lens.

**Diameters:**
1.  **Dark Rings:** `Dn = √(4nλR)` -> Proportional to √n (Natural numbers).
2.  **Bright Rings:** `Dn = √((2n-1)λR)` -> Proportional to √(Odd numbers).
    *   R = Radius of curvature of lens.
    *   λ = Wavelength.

### Q2. What is Rayleigh's Criterion for Resolution? (2 Marks)
**Answer:**
Two point sources are just resolved when the central maximum of the diffraction pattern of one falls on the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the other.

### Q1. Explain Diffraction Grating. Derive the grating equation. (10 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Diffraction Grating:** An arrangement consisting of a large number of parallel slits of equal width separated by equal opaque spaces.

**Grating Equation:**
*   Path difference `Δ = (e + d) sinθ`
*   For principal maxima: `(e + d) sinθ = nλ`
    *   `e + d` = Grating element.
    *   `n` = Order of spectrum.

### Q2. Differentiate between Interference and Diffraction. (5 Marks)
**Answer:**

| Interference | Diffraction |
| :--- | :--- |
| Superposition of waves from two coherent sources. | Bending of waves around corners/obstacles. |
| Fringes are usually of equal width. | Fringes are of unequal width. |
| All bright fringes have same intensity. | Intensity decreases for higher orders. |
| Dark fringes are perfectly dark. | Dark fringes are not perfectly dark. |
