### Q1. Explain the phenomenon of Global Warming and its consequences. (10 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Global Warming:** The gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans due to the Greenhouse Effect.

**Causes (Greenhouse Gases):**
*   Carbon Dioxide (CO2) - Burning fossil fuels.
*   Methane (CH4) - Agriculture, landfills.
*   Nitrous Oxide (N2O) - Fertilizers.
*   CFCs - Refrigerants.

**Consequences:**
1.  **Melting Ice Caps:** Rise in sea levels, coastal flooding.
2.  **Climate Change:** Extreme weather events (hurricanes, droughts).
3.  **Loss of Biodiversity:** Species extinction.
4.  **Agriculture:** Changing crop patterns, reduced yields.
5.  **Health:** Spread of tropical diseases (Malaria, Dengue).

### Q1. What is Acid Rain? How is it formed? (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Acid Rain:** Rainfall with a pH level less than 5.6.

**Formation:**
1.  Emission of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) from industries and vehicles.
2.  These gases react with water vapor in the atmosphere.
    *   SO2 + H2O -> H2SO4 (Sulfuric Acid)
    *   NOx + H2O -> HNO3 (Nitric Acid)
3.  Fall to earth as rain, snow, or fog.

**Effects:**
*   Damages buildings (Stone Leprosy).
*   Acidifies lakes/rivers (kills fish).
*   Damages forests (leaches nutrients).

### Q2. Discuss Ozone Layer Depletion. (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Ozone Layer:** Protective shield in the Stratosphere that absorbs harmful UV radiation.
**Cause:** Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) release Chlorine atoms which destroy Ozone (O3) molecules.
**Hole:** Prominent over Antarctica.
**Effects:**
*   Skin Cancer, Cataracts.
*   Damage to phytoplankton.
**Protocol:** Montreal Protocol (1987) to phase out ODS (Ozone Depleting Substances).
