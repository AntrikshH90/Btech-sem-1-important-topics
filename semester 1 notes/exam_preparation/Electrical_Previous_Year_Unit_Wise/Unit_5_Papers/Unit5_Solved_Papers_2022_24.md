### Q1. What is MCB? How does it differ from a Fuse? (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
**MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker):** An automatically operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current from an overload or short circuit.

**Difference:**

| Feature | Fuse | MCB |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Principle** | Works on heating effect of current. | Works on electromagnetic/thermal effect. |
| **Reusability** | Needs replacement after operation. | Can be reset and reused. |
| **Sensitivity** | Less sensitive. | More sensitive to current changes. |
| **Cost** | Cheaper. | More expensive. |

### Q2. Explain the construction and working of a Lead-Acid Battery. (10 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Construction:**
1.  **Positive Plate:** Lead Peroxide (PbO2).
2.  **Negative Plate:** Spongy Lead (Pb).
3.  **Electrolyte:** Dilute Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4).
4.  **Separator:** Insulating material between plates.

**Working:**
*   **Discharging:** Chemical energy converted to electrical energy. PbO2 and Pb convert to Lead Sulfate (PbSO4). Electrolyte density decreases.
*   **Charging:** Electrical energy converted to chemical energy. PbSO4 converts back to PbO2 and Pb. Electrolyte density increases.

### Q1. Why is Earthing necessary? Explain any one method of Earthing. (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Necessity:**
1.  To protect human life from electric shock.
2.  To protect electrical appliances from damage.
3.  To provide a low resistance path for leakage current.

**Method: Plate Earthing:**
*   A copper or GI plate is buried deep in the ground (usually > 2.5m).
*   Layers of charcoal and salt are placed around the plate to maintain moisture and reduce resistance.
*   A wire is connected from the plate to the main distribution board.

### Q2. Calculate the energy consumption in kWh for the following load used for 30 days:
*   4 Fans of 60W each for 10 hours/day.
*   2 Tube lights of 40W each for 5 hours/day.
*   1 TV of 100W for 4 hours/day. (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
1.  **Fans:** `4 * 60W * 10h = 2400 Wh`
2.  **Tube lights:** `2 * 40W * 5h = 400 Wh`
3.  **TV:** `1 * 100W * 4h = 400 Wh`
4.  **Total Daily Consumption:** `2400 + 400 + 400 = 3200 Wh = 3.2 kWh`
5.  **Monthly Consumption (30 days):** `3.2 * 30 = 96 kWh (Units)`
