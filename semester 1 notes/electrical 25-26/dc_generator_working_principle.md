# Working Principle of DC Generator (3-4 Marks)

## 1. Principle
A DC generator operates on the principle of **Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction**. It converts **Mechanical Energy** into **Electrical Energy**.

> **Law**: Whenever a conductor cuts magnetic field lines, an EMF is induced in it.

## 2. Working
1.  **Flux Cutting**: When the armature coil is rotated between magnet poles, its conductors cut the magnetic flux.
2.  **Induced EMF**: According to Faraday's law, an alternating EMF (AC) is generated in the coil.
3.  **Role of Commutator**: The **Split Ring Commutator** acts as a mechanical rectifier. It reverses the connections to the external circuit every half cycle, ensuring current flows in **one direction only (DC)**.

## 3. Direction & Formula
*   **Direction**: Determined by **Fleming’s Right-Hand Rule**.
*   **EMF Equation**:
    $$ E_g = \frac{P \phi Z N}{60 A} $$
    Where $P$=Poles, $\phi$=Flux, $Z$=Conductors, $N$=Speed, $A$=Parallel paths.
