## 🎯 Phase 2: The "70 Marks" Exam Strategy

### **Section A: The "Zero Error" Zone (20 Marks)**
*   **Goal:** 10/10 Correct.
*   **Risk:** Simple definition mistakes or forgetting units.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   Answer in **2-3 bullet points**. Never write paragraphs.
    *   **Always** write the formula if applicable (e.g., Define Q-factor -> Write definition + Formula).
    *   **Always** draw a small circuit/diagram if possible (e.g., KCL -> Draw a node with arrows).

### **Section B: Accurately Selected Derivations (30 Marks)**
*   **Goal:** Attempt 3 questions. Choose **Derivations** over Numericals if you are unsure about calculation.
*   **Best Choices:**
    1.  **Resonance Derivation** (Unit 2) - Standard steps, hard to mess up.
    2.  **Transformer EMF / Efficiency** (Unit 3) - Very logical.
    3.  **Torque-Slip Characteristics** (Unit 4) - Mostly graphical/theory.
    4.  **Star/Delta Derivation** (Unit 2) - Phasor diagram based.
*   **Avoid:** Complex DC circuit numericals in this section *unless* you are 100% confident (sign errors are fatal here).

### **Section C: The "Perfect Presentation" Zone (20 Marks)**
*   **Goal:** Attempt 1 from each unit.
*   **Protocol for 7 Marks:**
    1.  **Heading:** Start with a clear heading.
    2.  **Principal/Statement:** 2 lines.
    3.  **Diagram:** Draw a large, neat diagram (use pencil/scale). **Labels are mandatory.**
    4.  **Derivation/Explanation:** Step-by-step with equation numbers.
    5.  **Conclusion/Result:** Box the final formula.
    6.  **Numerical (if part of Q):**
        *   Given: ...
        *   Formula: ...
        *   Calculation: ...
        *   Answer: **[Boxed with Unit]**

## ⚠️ Phase 3: The Danger Zones (Where Students Lose Marks)
1.  **Calculator Mode:** Ensure it's in Degrees, not Radians (for AC circuits `sin(30)`).
2.  **Units:** Forgetting 'Hz', 'V', 'A', 'W', 'VAR' costs 0.5 - 1 mark.
3.  **Phasor Diagrams:** Drawing arrows in wrong direction (Lagging vs Leading).
4.  **Induction Motor:** Confusing $N$ (Rotor speed) and $N_s$ (Sync speed).
5.  **Efficiency:** Forgetting to convert kW to W or not multiplying by Power Factor ($kW = kVA \times pf$).

---

## 📅 Final 24-Hour Plan
1.  **Hour 0-2:** Memorize all **Unit 5** diagrams (Earthing, MCB).
2.  **Hour 2-5:** Practice **Derivations** (Resonance, Star/Delta, EMF) by hand.
3.  **Hour 5-8:** Solve **1 Numerical** from each type (Thevenin, Mesh, Transformer Efficiency).
4.  **Hour 8+:** Review **Section A** questions (Definitions/Formulas).

**Go get that 70!** 🚀
