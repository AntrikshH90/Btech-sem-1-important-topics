# Types of Wires and Cables (7 Marks)

> [!NOTE]
> **Key Difference:**
> *   **Wire:** A single conductor (usually bare or with thin insulation).
> *   **Cable:** A group of insulated conductors bunched together in a protective sheath.

## 1. Types of Wires (Internal Wiring)

These are used for domestic and internal wiring purposes.

### 1. **VIR** (Vulcanized Indian Rubber) Wire
*   **Material:** Conductor covered with VIR insulation and cotton tape saturated in bitumen.
*   **Drawback:** Rubber gets brittle over time. Unsafe.
*   **Status:** Obsolete (Rarely used now).

### 2. **PVC** (Poly Vinyl Chloride) Wire
*   **Material:** Conductor insulated with PVC.
*   **Advantage:** Waterproof, acid-proof, tough, and durable.
*   **Status:** **Most Common** wire used in homes today.

### 3. **CTS** (Cab Tyre Sheathed) or **TRS** (Tough Rubber Sheathed)
*   **Material:** Conductor with thick rubber sheathing (like tyre rubber).
*   **Advantage:** Waterproof.
*   **Drawback:** Cannot withstand direct sunlight (UV rays).

### 4. **Lead Sheathed** Wire
*   **Material:** VIR insulated wire covered with a continuous sheath of Lead.
*   **Advantage:** Excellent protection against moisture/dampness.
*   **Use:** Outdoors or damp places.

## 2. Types of Cables (Based on Voltage)

For underground or industrial transmission, cables are classified by their Voltage capacity.

| Type | Full Form | Voltage Range |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LT** | **L**ow **T**ension | Up to **1 kV** (1000 V) |
| **HT** | **H**igh **T**ension | Up to **11 kV** |
| **ST** | **S**uper **T**ension | **22 kV** to **33 kV** |
| **EHT** | **E**xtra **H**igh **T**ension | **33 kV** to **66 kV** |
| **EST** | **E**xtra **S**uper **T**ension | Above **132 kV** |
