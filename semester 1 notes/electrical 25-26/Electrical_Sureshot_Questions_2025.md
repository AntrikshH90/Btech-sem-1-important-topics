## ⚠️ SECTION A: Sureshot Short Questions (2 Marks Each)
*Memorize these definitions and formulas.*

*   **Unit 1:**
    *   **Kirchhoff's Laws:** Define KCL & KVL.
    *   **Source Conversion:** Convert ideal Voltage Source to Current Source.
    *   **Active vs Passive Elements:** Definitions with examples.

## 💡 Quick Tips for Exam
*   **Diagrams are King:** Even if the theory is weak, a neat labeled phasor diagram or circuit diagram gets you 50% marks immediately.
*   **Write Formulas:** Start every numerical or derivation by writing the core formula first.
*   **Units:** Never forget units (Volts, Amps, Watts, Hz) in numerical answers.
