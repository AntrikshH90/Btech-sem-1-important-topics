# Why is RAM called Volatile Memory? (Important 2 Marks)

## Q. Why is RAM (Random Access Memory) known as "Volatile" memory?

### **1. The Simple Answer**
RAM is called **volatile** because it **loses all its data** as soon as the **power supply is turned OFF**.
*   It is temporary memory.
*   If you are typing a document and the electricity goes out (without saving), your work is gone. This is because it was stored in RAM.

### **2. The Technical Reason**
*   **Electric dependency:** RAM stores data in the form of electric charges (in capacitors for DRAM) or electronic states (flip-flops for SRAM).
*   **Leakage:** These charges leak away very quickly. To maintain the data, RAM requires a constant refresh of electricity.
*   **Result:** When power flows, data exists. When power stops, the charges dissipate, and the data is erased.

### **3. Analogy (Real Life)**
Think of RAM like a **Calculator Screen**:
*   While the calculator is ON, you see the numbers.
*   The moment you turn it OFF, the numbers vanish.

*Contrast this with a Hard Disk (Non-Volatile), which is like writing in a Notebook (stays forever).*

### **Summary Table (For Exam)**

| Feature | RAM (Volatile) | Hard Disk (Non-Volatile) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Retention** | **Lost** when power is OFF. | **Retained** when power is OFF. |
| **Dependency** | Needs constant power. | Does not need constant power. |
| **Duration** | Temporary / Short-term. | Permanent / Long-term. |
