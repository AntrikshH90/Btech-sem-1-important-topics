# Algorithm & Its Characteristics (Important 7 Marks)

## Q. What is an Algorithm? Discuss its key characteristics.

### **1. Definition**
An **Algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or a set of well-defined instructions to solve a specific problem.
*   It is written in simple English (not code).
*   It acts as a "blueprint" before writing the actual program.

> **Analogy:** A recipe to cook food.

### **2. Characteristics of an Algorithm**
For an algorithm to be valid, it must satisfy the following **5 properties**:

1.  **Input:**
    *   An algorithm must accept **0 or more inputs**.
    *   These are the raw materials needed to solve the problem.

2.  **Output:**
    *   It must produce **at least 1 output**.
    *   This is the final result after processing.

3.  **Definiteness (Clarity):**
    *   Every step must be **clear and unambiguous**.
    *   There should be no confusion about what to do in any step.

4.  **Finiteness (Ends):**
    *   The algorithm must **terminate** (stop) after a finite number of steps.
    *   It should not go into an infinite loop.

5.  **Effectiveness:**
    *   Every step must be simple enough to be performed manually (using pen and paper).
    *   It should be feasible and practical.

> **Mnemonic:** **I D O F E** (Input, Definiteness, Output, Finiteness, Effectiveness)

### **3. Example: Algorithm to Add Two Numbers**

**Step 1:** Start.
**Step 2:** Declare three variables `a`, `b`, and `sum`.
**Step 3:** Read the values of `a` and `b` (Input).
**Step 4:** Calculate `sum = a + b`.
**Step 5:** Print `sum` (Output).
**Step 6:** Stop.
