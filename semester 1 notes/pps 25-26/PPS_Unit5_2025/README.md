## ✅ Exam Day Checklist

### Before Exam:
- [ ] Reviewed all ⭐⭐⭐ questions
- [ ] Can write at least 5 programs from memory
- [ ] Understand malloc vs calloc
- [ ] Know structure vs union differences
- [ ] Remember file handling functions
- [ ] Practiced pointer programs

### During Exam:
- [ ] Read question carefully
- [ ] Identify topic (pointers/structures/files)
- [ ] Write syntax first, then explanation
- [ ] Include examples in theory answers
- [ ] Add comments in programs
- [ ] Check for syntax errors

---

## 💡 Exam Writing Tips

### For Theory Questions:
1. **Start with definition** - Clear and concise
2. **Explain with syntax** - Show the format
3. **Give examples** - Small code snippets
4. **Draw diagrams** - For pointers, memory layout
5. **Write advantages/disadvantages** - If asked
6. **Conclude** - Summarize the concept

### For Programs:
1. **Include headers** - #include <stdio.h>, etc.
2. **Add comments** - Explain logic
3. **Proper indentation** - Makes code readable
4. **Variable names** - Use meaningful names
5. **Error handling** - Check NULL pointers, file errors
6. **Sample output** - Write expected output as comment

## 🎓 Important Points to Remember

### Pointers:
- `&` = address-of operator
- `*` = dereference operator
- Pointer arithmetic moves by data type size

### DMA:
- Always check if malloc/calloc returns NULL
- Always free() allocated memory
- malloc doesn't initialize, calloc initializes to 0

### Structures:
- Use `.` for structure variables
- Use `->` for structure pointers
- Structure size may include padding

### Unions:
- All members share same memory
- Size = size of largest member
- Only one member can hold value at a time

### File Handling:
- Always check if fopen() succeeds
- Always close files with fclose()
- "r" - read, "w" - write, "a" - append

## 🔥 Last Minute Revision

### Must Remember Syntax:

**malloc:**
```c
int *ptr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
```

**calloc:**
```c
int *ptr = (int*)calloc(n, sizeof(int));
```

**Structure:**
```c
struct Student {
    int roll;
    char name[50];
};
```

**File Open:**
```c
FILE *fp = fopen("file.txt", "r");
```

**Command Line:**
```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
```

## 📞 Quick Reference

### Common Errors to Avoid:
1. ❌ Not checking NULL after malloc/fopen
2. ❌ Forgetting to free() memory
3. ❌ Using wrong file mode
4. ❌ Not closing files
5. ❌ Accessing uninitialized pointers
6. ❌ Buffer overflow in strings

### Time Management:
- Theory (5 marks): 7-8 minutes
- Program (10 marks): 12-15 minutes
- Keep 10 minutes for final revision
