### Q1. Derive Time-Independent Schrödinger Wave Equation. (10 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Schrödinger Wave Equation:** Describes the wave nature of a particle.

**Derivation Steps:**
1.  Consider a particle of mass 'm' moving with velocity 'v'.
2.  Total Energy (E) = Kinetic Energy (K) + Potential Energy (V).
    *   `E = p^2/2m + V`
3.  Wave function `Ψ = A e^(-iωt)`.
4.  Differentiate Ψ w.r.t 'x' twice to get `d²Ψ/dx²`.
5.  Use de-Broglie relation `λ = h/p`.
6.  Substitute values to get:
    *   **`∇²Ψ + (2m/ħ²)(E - V)Ψ = 0`**
    *   Where `ħ = h/2π`.

### Q2. Explain Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. (2 Marks)
**Answer:**
It is impossible to determine simultaneously the exact position and exact momentum of a moving particle.
*   **Formula:** `Δx · Δp ≥ h/4π`
*   Where `Δx` = Uncertainty in position, `Δp` = Uncertainty in momentum.

### Q1. What is Compton Effect? Derive the expression for Compton Shift. (10 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Compton Effect:** When a monochromatic X-ray falls on a scattering material (like graphite), the scattered X-ray has a larger wavelength (lower frequency) than the incident X-ray.

**Derivation Key Points:**
1.  Apply Law of Conservation of Energy and Momentum.
2.  Collision between photon and electron is elastic.
3.  **Compton Shift Formula:** `Δλ = λ' - λ = (h/m₀c)(1 - cosθ)`
    *   `h/m₀c` = Compton Wavelength (0.0242 Å).
    *   `θ` = Scattering angle.

### Q2. A particle is in a 1-D box of length 'L'. Find its energy eigenvalues. (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
For a particle in a 1-D box (Infinite Potential Well):
*   Potential V = 0 inside, ∞ outside.
*   **Energy Eigenvalues:** `En = (n²h²) / (8mL²)`
    *   Where n = 1, 2, 3... (Quantum number).
    *   Energy is quantized.
