### Q1. Write Maxwell's Equations in differential form. (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
1.  **Gauss's Law for Electrostatics:** `∇ · D = ρ` (Divergence of D is charge density).
2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** `∇ · B = 0` (No magnetic monopoles).
3.  **Faraday's Law:** `∇ × E = -∂B/∂t` (Changing magnetic field produces electric field).
4.  **Modified Ampere's Law:** `∇ × H = J + ∂D/∂t` (Conduction + Displacement current).

### Q2. What is Poynting Vector? Derive Poynting Theorem. (10 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Poynting Vector (P):** Represents the rate of flow of energy per unit area per unit time in an EM wave.
*   **Formula:** `P = E × H` (Unit: Watt/m²)

**Poynting Theorem:** "The rate of decrease of stored energy in the electromagnetic field is equal to the rate of work done plus the rate of energy flow out of the volume."
*   **Equation:** `-∂U/∂t = ∫(J·E)dV + ∫(E×H)·dS`

### Q1. Show that EM waves are transverse in nature. (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
1.  Consider a plane EM wave propagating in z-direction.
2.  Use Maxwell's equations `∇ · E = 0` and `∇ · B = 0`.
3.  Since `∂/∂x = 0` and `∂/∂y = 0` (Plane wave), we get `∂Ez/∂z = 0` -> `Ez = constant`.
4.  Constant field is static, not wave. So `Ez = 0` and `Bz = 0`.
5.  Since fields are zero in direction of propagation, they must be perpendicular (transverse).

### Q2. Define Skin Depth (Penetration Depth). (2 Marks)
**Answer:**
The distance/depth at which the amplitude of an EM wave reduces to `1/e` (approx 37%) of its initial value while propagating through a conductor.
*   **Formula:** `δ = √(2 / ωμσ)`
*   Inversely proportional to frequency and conductivity.
