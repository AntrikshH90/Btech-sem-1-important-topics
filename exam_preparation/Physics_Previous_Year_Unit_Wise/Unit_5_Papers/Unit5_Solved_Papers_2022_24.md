### Q1. What is Meissner Effect? Distinguish between Type I and Type II superconductors. (10 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Meissner Effect:** The expulsion of magnetic flux lines from the interior of a superconductor when it is cooled below critical temperature (Tc). It behaves as a perfect diamagnet (`χ = -1`).

**Difference:**

| Type I (Soft) | Type II (Hard) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Follows Meissner effect strictly. | Follows Meissner effect partially (Vortex state). |
| Low critical field (Hc). | High critical field. |
| Abrupt loss of superconductivity. | Gradual loss. |
| Ex: Lead, Mercury. | Ex: Niobium-Tin alloys. |

### Q2. Explain Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) and their applications. (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
**CNTs:** Cylindrical nanostructure allotropes of carbon (rolled graphene sheets).
*   **Types:** Single-walled (SWCNT), Multi-walled (MWCNT).
*   **Properties:** High tensile strength, high conductivity.
*   **Applications:** Composite materials, electronics (transistors), drug delivery, energy storage.

### Q1. Discuss BCS Theory of Superconductivity. (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
**BCS Theory (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer):**
1.  **Cooper Pairs:** Electrons form pairs due to interaction with lattice vibrations (phonons).
2.  These pairs move without resistance through the lattice.
3.  Energy gap exists between ground state and excited state.
4.  Explains Type I superconductivity well.

### Q2. What are Nanomaterials? Explain 'Top-down' and 'Bottom-up' approaches. (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Nanomaterials:** Materials with at least one dimension in the range 1-100 nm.

**Synthesis Approaches:**
1.  **Top-Down:** Breaking down bulk material into nano-sized particles.
    *   *Ex:* Ball milling, Lithography.
2.  **Bottom-Up:** Assembling atoms/molecules to form nanostructures.
    *   *Ex:* Sol-gel method, CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition).
