**Answer:**
**Ecosystem:** A self-sustaining structural and functional unit of the biosphere consisting of living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components interacting with each other.

**Structure:**
1.  **Abiotic Components:**
    *   Physical: Temperature, Light, Soil.
    *   Chemical: Water, Oxygen, Minerals.
2.  **Biotic Components:**
    *   **Producers (Autotrophs):** Green plants (Photosynthesis).
    *   **Consumers (Heterotrophs):**
        *   Primary (Herbivores)
        *   Secondary (Carnivores)
        *   Tertiary (Top Carnivores)
    *   **Decomposers (Saprotrophs):** Bacteria, Fungi (Recycle nutrients).

**Functions:**
1.  **Energy Flow:** Unidirectional flow from Sun -> Producers -> Consumers.
2.  **Nutrient Cycling:** Biogeochemical cycles (Carbon, Nitrogen).
3.  **Food Chains/Webs:** Transfer of food energy.
4.  **Ecological Succession:** Gradual change in species composition.

**Q2. Differentiate between Food Chain and Food Web. (5 Marks)**
**Answer:**
| Feature | Food Chain | Food Web |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Linear sequence of organisms where nutrients and energy are transferred. | Network of interconnected food chains. |
| **Pathways** | Single path. | Multiple paths. |
| **Stability** | Less stable (if one member is removed, chain breaks). | More stable (alternative food sources available). |
| **Example** | Grass -> Deer -> Lion | Grass -> Grasshopper -> Frog -> Snake -> Eagle. |

3.  Planting trees (Green Belt).
4.  Strict emission norms (Bharat Stage VI).

### Unit 4: Current Environmental Issues
**Q1. Explain the phenomenon of Global Warming and its consequences. (10 Marks)**
**Answer:**
**Global Warming:** The gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans due to the Greenhouse Effect.

**Causes (Greenhouse Gases):**
*   Carbon Dioxide (CO2) - Burning fossil fuels.
*   Methane (CH4) - Agriculture, landfills.
*   Nitrous Oxide (N2O) - Fertilizers.
*   CFCs - Refrigerants.

**Consequences:**
1.  **Melting Ice Caps:** Rise in sea levels, coastal flooding.
2.  **Climate Change:** Extreme weather events (hurricanes, droughts).
3.  **Loss of Biodiversity:** Species extinction.
4.  **Agriculture:** Changing crop patterns, reduced yields.
5.  **Health:** Spread of tropical diseases (Malaria, Dengue).

### Unit 5: Environmental Protection & Social Issues
**Q1. Discuss the salient features of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. (10 Marks)**
**Answer:**
**Environment Protection Act (1986):** Enacted after the Bhopal Gas Tragedy. It is an "Umbrella Legislation".

**Salient Features:**
1.  **Central Govt Powers:** Empowers Central Govt to take all measures to protect and improve the environment.
2.  **Standards:** Lay down standards for emission/discharge of pollutants.
3.  **Prohibitions:** Restrict industrial operations in sensitive areas.
4.  **Penalties:** Fine up to ₹1 Lakh or imprisonment up to 5 years, or both.
5.  **Entry & Inspection:** Power to enter and inspect any industrial unit.
6.  **Public Liability:** Handling of hazardous substances.
