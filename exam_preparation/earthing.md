# Pipe Earthing and Plate Earthing (7 Marks - AKTU)

## **1. Introduction to Earthing**

Earthing (or grounding) is the process of connecting the non-current carrying metallic parts of electrical equipment to the earth through a conductor of negligible resistance. This ensures safety by providing a low-resistance path for fault currents to flow into the ground, preventing electric shocks and equipment damage.

## **2. Pipe Earthing**

### **Definition:**
Pipe earthing is a type of earthing system where a galvanized iron (GI) pipe or perforated pipe is vertically embedded into the ground to establish a connection with the earth.

### **Construction & Components:**

1. **GI Pipe:** A galvanized iron pipe of diameter 38-50 mm and length 2-3 meters is used.
2. **Pipe Placement:** The pipe is vertically buried in permanently wet soil at a depth of 4-5 meters.
3. **Perforations:** Holes of 12-15 mm diameter are drilled in the pipe at regular intervals to improve contact with soil.
4. **Earthing Lead:** A GI wire (8 SWG) or copper wire is connected to the pipe using nuts, bolts, and washers.
5. **Surrounding Material:** The pipe is surrounded by alternate layers of:
   - Salt (common salt - NaCl)
   - Charcoal (powdered coal)
   - These materials reduce soil resistance and retain moisture.

### **Working Principle:**
When fault current flows through the earthing lead, it passes through the pipe and dissipates into the surrounding soil. The salt and charcoal mixture maintains low resistance by keeping the soil moist and conductive.

### **Advantages:**
- Simple and economical installation
- Suitable for areas with high water table
- Low maintenance
- Effective for residential and small industrial applications

### **Disadvantages:**
- Pipe may corrode over time
- Requires periodic maintenance (adding salt and charcoal)
- Not suitable for rocky or dry soil

## **3. Plate Earthing**

### **Definition:**
Plate earthing is an earthing system where a copper or galvanized iron (GI) plate is buried horizontally or vertically in the ground to provide earth connection.

### **Construction & Components:**

1. **Earth Plate:** 
   - **Copper plate:** 600 mm × 600 mm × 3.15 mm (minimum)
   - **GI plate:** 600 mm × 600 mm × 6.3 mm (minimum)
2. **Plate Placement:** The plate is buried at a depth of 3-4 meters below ground level.
3. **Earthing Lead:** A copper or GI wire is securely bolted to the plate using nuts and bolts.
4. **Surrounding Material:** The plate is embedded in alternate layers of:
   - Salt (to enhance conductivity)
   - Charcoal (to retain moisture and reduce resistance)
   - The pit is filled with these materials around the plate.

### **Working Principle:**
During a fault, the leakage current flows through the earthing conductor to the buried plate. The large surface area of the plate ensures effective dissipation of current into the earth, maintaining low earth resistance.

### **Advantages:**
- Provides better earth resistance due to larger contact area
- More durable than pipe earthing
- Suitable for rocky or dry soil conditions
- Longer lifespan

### **Disadvantages:**
- More expensive than pipe earthing
- Requires larger excavation area
- Installation is more complex

## **6. Important Formulas**

### **Earth Resistance:**

For Pipe Earthing:
```
R = (ρ / 2πL) × ln(4L/d)
```
Where:
- R = Earth resistance (Ω)
- ρ = Soil resistivity (Ω-m)
- L = Length of pipe (m)
- d = Diameter of pipe (m)

For Plate Earthing:
```
R = ρ / (4 × √A)
```
Where:
- R = Earth resistance (Ω)
- ρ = Soil resistivity (Ω-m)
- A = Area of plate (m²)

## **7. Conclusion**

Both pipe earthing and plate earthing are effective methods for electrical safety. The choice between them depends on:
- **Soil conditions** (wet vs. dry/rocky)
- **Budget constraints**
- **Application requirements** (residential vs. industrial)
- **Maintenance capabilities**

Proper earthing is essential to prevent electric shocks, protect equipment from damage, and ensure compliance with electrical safety standards.
