# Difference: Algorithm vs Flowchart vs Pseudocode (7 Marks)

## Q. Differentiate between Algorithm, Flowchart, and Pseudocode.

These are the three tools used to **plan** a program before writing the actual code.

### **1. Comparison Table (Key Differences)**

| Feature | Algorithm | Flowchart | Pseudocode |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | **Textural** (Plain English). | **Graphical** (Diagrams/Shapes). | **Code-like Text** (Structured English). |
| **Representation**| Step-by-step paragraphs. | Geometric shapes (Rectangles, Diamonds). | Short, precise keywords (IF, ELSE, FOR). |
| **Rules** | No specific rules. Flexible. | Strict rules for symbols (Input=Parallelogram). | Loose syntax rules (like C/Python). |
| **Understandability**| Easy for non-programmers. | Easy to see **flow of logic**. | Bridge between logic and actual code. |
| **Conversion** | Harder to convert to code directly. | Good for visualization. | Easiest to convert to code. |

### **2. Similar Examples (Adding Two Numbers)**

To clear the confusion, look at how the **Same Logic** looks in three different ways:

#### **A. Algorithm (The Idea)**
*   **Step 1:** Start.
*   **Step 2:** Take two numbers as input.
*   **Step 3:** Add them together.
*   **Step 4:** Show the result.
*   **Step 5:** Stop.

#### **B. Flowchart (The Diagram)**
*(Imagine the shapes)*
1.  **Oval:** Start
2.  **Parallelogram:** Input A, B
3.  **Rectangle:** Sum = A + B
4.  **Parallelogram:** Print Sum
5.  **Oval:** Stop

#### **C. Pseudocode (The Rough Draft)**
```text
BEGIN
   INPUT A, B
   Sum = A + B
   PRINT Sum
END
```

### **3. Detailed Definitions**

1.  **Algorithm:**
    *   It is a logical sequence of steps to solve a problem. It aims to explain *logic*.

2.  **Flowchart:**
    *   It is a pictorial representation of an algorithm. It aims to visualize *flow*.
    *   **Common Symbols:**
        *   Oval: Start/Stop
        *   Parallelogram: Input/Output
        *   Rectangle: Processing (Calculations)
        *   Diamond: Decision (Yes/No)

3.  **Pseudocode:**
    *   "Pseudo" means "Fake". So, it is "Fake Code".
    *   It looks like code but cannot be compiled. It helps programmers structure the code before typing it in C/Python.
