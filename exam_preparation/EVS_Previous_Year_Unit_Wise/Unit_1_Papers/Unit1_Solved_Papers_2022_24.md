### Q1. Define Ecosystem. Explain the structure and function of an ecosystem. (10 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Ecosystem:** A self-sustaining structural and functional unit of the biosphere consisting of living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components interacting with each other.

**Structure:**
1.  **Abiotic Components:**
    *   Physical: Temperature, Light, Soil.
    *   Chemical: Water, Oxygen, Minerals.
2.  **Biotic Components:**
    *   **Producers (Autotrophs):** Green plants (Photosynthesis).
    *   **Consumers (Heterotrophs):**
        *   Primary (Herbivores)
        *   Secondary (Carnivores)
        *   Tertiary (Top Carnivores)
    *   **Decomposers (Saprotrophs):** Bacteria, Fungi (Recycle nutrients).

**Functions:**
1.  **Energy Flow:** Unidirectional flow from Sun -> Producers -> Consumers.
2.  **Nutrient Cycling:** Biogeochemical cycles (Carbon, Nitrogen).
3.  **Food Chains/Webs:** Transfer of food energy.
4.  **Ecological Succession:** Gradual change in species composition.

### Q2. Differentiate between Food Chain and Food Web. (5 Marks)
**Answer:**

| Feature | Food Chain | Food Web |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Linear sequence of organisms where nutrients and energy are transferred. | Network of interconnected food chains. |
| **Pathways** | Single path. | Multiple paths. |
| **Stability** | Less stable (if one member is removed, chain breaks). | More stable (alternative food sources available). |
| **Example** | Grass -> Deer -> Lion | Grass -> Grasshopper -> Frog -> Snake -> Eagle (interconnected with others). |

### Q1. Explain the concept of Ecological Pyramids. (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Ecological Pyramid:** Graphical representation of the trophic structure and function of an ecosystem.

**Types:**
1.  **Pyramid of Number:** Represents the number of individuals at each trophic level.
    *   *Upright:* Grassland ecosystem.
    *   *Inverted:* Parasitic food chain (Tree -> Birds -> Parasites).
2.  **Pyramid of Biomass:** Represents the total dry weight of living matter.
    *   *Upright:* Forest ecosystem.
    *   *Inverted:* Pond ecosystem (Phytoplankton < Zooplankton).
3.  **Pyramid of Energy:** Represents the amount of energy at each level.
    *   **ALWAYS Upright:** Energy decreases at each successive trophic level (10% Law).

### Q2. What is the Multidisciplinary nature of Environmental Studies? (2 Marks)
**Answer:**
Environmental studies deal with every issue that affects an organism. It is multidisciplinary because it includes:
*   **Life Sciences:** Biology, Botany (Flora/Fauna).
*   **Physical Sciences:** Chemistry (Pollution), Physics (Energy flow).
*   **Mathematics/Statistics:** Data analysis.
*   **Social Sciences:** Sociology, Economics (Resource management).
*   **Law:** Environmental protection acts.
