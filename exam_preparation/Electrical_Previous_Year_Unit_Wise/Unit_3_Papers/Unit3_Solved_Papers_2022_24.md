### Q1. Explain the principle of operation of a Single Phase Transformer. Derive its EMF equation. (10 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Principle:** Works on the principle of Mutual Induction. When an alternating voltage is applied to the primary winding, an alternating flux is produced in the core, which links with the secondary winding and induces an EMF in it.

**EMF Equation:**
*   Let `N1` = Primary turns, `N2` = Secondary turns.
*   `Φm` = Maximum flux = `Bm * A`.
*   `f` = Frequency.
*   **Equation:** `E = 4.44 f Φm N`
    *   Primary EMF: `E1 = 4.44 f Φm N1`
    *   Secondary EMF: `E2 = 4.44 f Φm N2`

### Q2. A single phase transformer has 400 primary and 1000 secondary turns. The net cross-sectional area of the core is 60 cm². If the primary winding is connected to a 50Hz supply at 520V, calculate: (i) Peak value of flux density (ii) Voltage induced in secondary. (10 Marks)
**Answer:**
Given: `N1 = 400`, `N2 = 1000`, `A = 60 cm² = 60 x 10^-4 m²`, `f = 50Hz`, `E1 = 520V`.

1.  **Peak Flux Density (Bm):**
    *   `E1 = 4.44 f Bm A N1`
    *   `520 = 4.44 * 50 * Bm * (60 * 10^-4) * 400`
    *   `Bm = 520 / (4.44 * 50 * 0.006 * 400) = 0.976 Wb/m²`
2.  **Secondary Voltage (E2):**
    *   `E2 / E1 = N2 / N1`
    *   `E2 = E1 * (N2 / N1) = 520 * (1000 / 400) = 1300V`

### Q1. Draw and explain the phasor diagram of a practical transformer on no load. (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
**No Load Phasor Diagram:**
*   `V1` is the applied voltage.
*   `Io` is the no-load current, which has two components:
    *   `Iw` (Working component) in phase with `V1`.
    *   `Im` (Magnetizing component) lagging `V1` by 90°.
*   `Io = √(Iw² + Im²)`
*   `E1` and `E2` lag the flux `Φ` by 90°.
*   `V1` leads `E1` by 180° (approximately).

### Q2. Define Efficiency of a transformer. Derive the condition for maximum efficiency. (5 Marks)
**Answer:**
**Efficiency (η):** Ratio of Output Power to Input Power.
*   `η = (Output Power) / (Output Power + Losses)`
*   `η = (V2 I2 cosφ) / (V2 I2 cosφ + Pi + I2² R2eq)`

**Condition for Max Efficiency:**
*   Variable Loss (Copper Loss) = Constant Loss (Iron Loss)
*   `I2² R2eq = Pi`
