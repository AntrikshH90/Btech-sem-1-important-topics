# Differences Among Assembler, Loader, and Linker

This document explains the roles and differences between an Assembler, a Linker, and a Loader in the context of program execution.

## 1. High-Level Flow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates how these components interact to transform your source code into a running program.

## 2. Detailed Explanations

### Assembler
**Definition**: An assembler is a program that translates assembly language code (mnemonics) into machine code (object code) that the computer's processor can understand directly.
*   **Input**: Assembly Language source code (e.g., `MOV AX, B`).
*   **Output**: Object code (binary sequence) usually in a file ending with `.o` or `.obj`.
*   **Role**: It performs a 1-to-1 mapping from assembly instructions to machine machine opcodes. It also handles symbol resolution for labels within the file.

### Linker
**Definition**: A linker is a system program that combines one or more object files (generated by the assembler/compiler) and library files into a single executable file.
*   **Input**: One or more Object files (`.o`, `.obj`) and Library files (`.lib`, `.a`).
*   **Output**: Executable file (e.g., `.exe`, `.out`).
*   **Role**: 
    *   **Resolution**: It resolves references to external symbols (e.g., if you use `printf`, the linker finds where `printf` is defined in the library).
    *   **Combination**: It merges code and data sections from multiple files into a single file.

### Loader
**Definition**: A loader is a part of the Operating System that is responsible for loading the executable program from the disk (secondary storage) into the main memory (RAM) so that it can be executed by the CPU.
*   **Input**: Executable file.
*   **Output**: A running process in Memory.
*   **Role**: 
    *   Allocates memory for the program.
    *   Initializes registers and stack.
    *   Maps virtual addresses to physical addresses (relocation).
    *   Transfers control to the entry point of the program (usually `main`).

## 3. Comparison Table

| Feature | Assembler | Linker | Loader |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Function** | Translates assembly code to machine code (binary). | Combines object files and libraries to create an executable. | Loads the executable from disk into RAM for execution. |
| **Input** | Assembly Language Source File (`.s` or `.asm`). | Object Files (`.o`, `.obj`) and Logical Libraries. | Executable Binary File (`.exe`, `.out`). |
| **Output** | Object File (Relocatable Machine Code). | Executable File. | Program execution in Memory. |
| **Types** | One-pass, Two-pass assemblers. | Static Linker, Dynamic Linker. | Absolute Loader, Relocating Loader, Bootstrap Loader. |
| **Component Of** | Often part of the Compilation process. | System Utility (part of build tools). | Operating System (OS). |
| **Key Operation** | Mnemonics $\to$ Opcodes mapping. | Symbol resolution & Address binding (logical). | Memory allocation & Address binding (physical). |
